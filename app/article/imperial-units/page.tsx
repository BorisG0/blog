        Compared to the metric system, the imperial system or the United States customary units provide a way of verifying the value of a unit
        without needing to trust a central authrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it makes sense that the metric system is accurate, easy to convert and avoids confusion, it does not provide a way to help in a
        measurement dispute between two independent parties. The odd ratios like 12 inches in a foot do not matter if you are not converting
        anything because you can choose a fitting unit right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meter and the whole metric system are abstract and useful for scientists and complicated calculations. The modern meter is based on
        constants like the speed of light, which no one but a few expert scientist can verify (unless using your microwave to measure the speed
        of light at home, link coming soon). Even if you know the speed of light exactly it is not an easy task to get a measurement of a meter
        from it (needing some way to measure extremely small fractions of a second).
      </p>
      <p>
        Original definitions of the meters describe it as one tenth of a million of the fourth of the circumference of the earth. Which is also
        not possible to verify for regular people.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use the metric system you require someone to give you a measurement of a meter. Which is passed from the original source through many
        different parties with no guarantee of correctness. Let&apos;s say all known measurements of the meter were suddenly erased. Before going
        out and starting to measure it again using the speed of light in a complicated process, the only thing left is the intuition of people
        which is, in the case of the meter, based on no tangible concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inches and feet can be used by anyone in a desert without access to any authorities telling you what a meter is. A mismatch in foot
        sizes is a much easier discussion than that of the speed of light. And units exist to be used by everyone, not only scientists or some
        logic and conversion elitists. The only science I trust is the one I can verify myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least europeans and science and logic fetishists can agree with useful unit perpetuators on the second. Fortunately god has gifted us
        with a constant rotation of the earth around itself creating a timekeeping mechanism seen by everyone. Try coming up with a more logical
        time measurement and distribute it around people.
